<h1>ATM System App (C# - .NET Framework)ðŸš€</h1>
This Bank System application is a simple windows form application developed using C# and the .NET Framework, focusing on implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows basic banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and viewing account details.<br><br>

<ul>
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Secure handling of account data through private fields and public methods.</li>
<li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: Utilizing base and derived classes for different account types (e.g., Savings, Checking).</li>
<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: Method overriding and overloading to handle different transaction behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Abstract classes or interfaces to define common behaviors for account management.</li>
</ul>
The project operates <strong>without database connectivity</strong>, relying on in-memory data structures to manage account information during runtime.<br><br>
